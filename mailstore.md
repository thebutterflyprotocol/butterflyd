Mail store
==========

Butterfly manages mail in the following manner.

All accounts have their mailboxes located in a folder called `mailboxes/`.

So Alice and Bob will have their respective mailbox directories in `mailboxes/alice` and `mailboxes/bob`.

In each `mailboxes/<mailbox>` we have a group of more directories which represet mail folders, such as `mailboxes/<mailbox>/folder1` and `mailboxes/<mailbox>/folder1/folder2`.
